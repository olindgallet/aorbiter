I am making my source code for this project available under the MIT license in hopes of helping you out in your programming journey.  Much of the code is documented and I will provide instructions on how to build the project. If there's anything that's unclear feel free to contact me.

# How to Get Started
1. Fork a copy of everything.
2. Go to the command line and install node.js.  
3. While still in the command line install the modules needed in `gruntfile.js`.  For Windows it'd be `npm install -g` then the module name.
4. While still in the command line compile the program by typing `grunt compiletest`.  Note that you can also type `grunt compile` to get a minified version, but the test version is easier to debug.
5. Make changes, break some code.  I recommend starting with `js_dev/gui/all/GraphicsConstants.js` and changing some values, compiling, and seeing what happens.
